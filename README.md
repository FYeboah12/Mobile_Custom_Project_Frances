# Sight Reading Made Easy
## Created by Frances Yeboah

Hello, this is my custom project for my Mobile App Development Class. 
This app runs in Android and was coded with Java and XML. 

### Features
The purpose of this app is for users to improve their sight reading skills. I also provide a way to hear the notes. I am in a music class right now, and sight reading is not my strong suit, so I created this app so that I and other users can memorize musical notes across different clefs.

#### Quiz Component
There is a note written in a particular clef. Using your phone's keyboard, type your guess for that note. If it is correct, you get to hear the piano note, and select a different instrument to hear it if applicable. If it is incorrect, the phone will vibrate and you'll have to guess again.
Hint: notes go from A-G!
